            <h2>Historical Context</h2>
            <p>Gender equality has been a long-standing goal with deep historical roots. Here are some key milestones in the journey:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>19th Century:</strong> The early women's rights movements, such as the Seneca Falls Convention (1848), marked the first formal demand for gender equality in areas like voting, education, and property rights.</li>
                <li><strong>20th Century:</strong> Women's suffrage movements achieved significant victories, including the 19th Amendment in the United States (1920) and similar achievements in other nations.</li>
                <li><strong>Mid-20th Century:</strong> The feminist waves of the 1960s and 1970s brought attention to workplace inequality, reproductive rights, and societal gender roles.</li>
                <li><strong>1995 - Beijing Declaration:</strong> At the Fourth World Conference on Women, global leaders committed to advancing gender equality through the Beijing Platform for Action.</li>
                <li><strong>2015 - Sustainable Development Goals:</strong> The United Nations established Goal 5, explicitly focusing on achieving gender equality and empowering women and girls globally.</li>
                <li><strong>21st Century:</strong> Movements like #MeToo and Time’s Up have raised awareness about gender-based violence and workplace discrimination, pushing for systemic change.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These milestones demonstrate the relentless efforts of advocates and communities worldwide, though much work remains to achieve true gender equality.</p>
