                    <p>Gender equality refers to the equal rights, responsibilities, and opportunities of all individuals, regardless of their gender. It is a fundamental human right that is essential for achieving peaceful, prosperous, and sustainable societies. Gender equality is not only a matter of fairness; it is also a vital factor in reducing poverty, promoting economic growth, and improving overall well-being.</p>
                    <p>This concept entails the removal of barriers that prevent individuals from realizing their potential based solely on gender. It includes issues related to gender identity and expression, recognizing the experiences of transgender and non-binary individuals, and ensuring that all genders can participate fully in society.</p>

            <h2>Historical Context</h2>
            <p>The pursuit of gender equality has a rich history. The women's suffrage movement of the early 20th century marked a pivotal point, as women fought for the right to vote in many countries. In the mid-20th century, the feminist movements sought to challenge traditional gender roles and advocate for women’s rights in the workplace, education, and reproductive health.</p>
            <p>Global frameworks, such as the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action (1995) and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (2015), have established gender equality as a priority for development. These frameworks emphasize that gender equality is not only a goal but also a catalyst for achieving broader development objectives.</p>
